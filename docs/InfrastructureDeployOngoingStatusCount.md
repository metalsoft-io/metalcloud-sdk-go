## Methods

### NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount

`func NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount(thrownErrorRetrying float32, thrownError float32, ) *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount`

NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount instantiates a new InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCountWithDefaults

`func NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCountWithDefaults() *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount`

NewInfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCountWithDefaults instantiates a new InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetThrownErrorRetrying

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) GetThrownErrorRetrying() float32`

GetThrownErrorRetrying returns the ThrownErrorRetrying field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetThrownErrorRetryingOk

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) GetThrownErrorRetryingOk() (*float32, bool)`

GetThrownErrorRetryingOk returns a tuple with the ThrownErrorRetrying field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetThrownErrorRetrying

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) SetThrownErrorRetrying(v float32)`

SetThrownErrorRetrying sets ThrownErrorRetrying field to given value.


### GetThrownError

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) GetThrownError() float32`

GetThrownError returns the ThrownError field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetThrownErrorOk

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) GetThrownErrorOk() (*float32, bool)`

GetThrownErrorOk returns a tuple with the ThrownError field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetThrownError

`func (o *InfrastructureDeployOngoingStatusCount) SetThrownError(v float32)`

SetThrownError sets ThrownError field to given value.
