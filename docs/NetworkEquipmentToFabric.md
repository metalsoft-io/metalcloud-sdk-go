## Methods

### NewNetworkEquipmentToFabric

`func NewNetworkEquipmentToFabric(networkEquipmentIds []float32, ) *NetworkEquipmentToFabric`

NewNetworkEquipmentToFabric instantiates a new NetworkEquipmentToFabric object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewNetworkEquipmentToFabricWithDefaults

`func NewNetworkEquipmentToFabricWithDefaults() *NetworkEquipmentToFabric`

NewNetworkEquipmentToFabricWithDefaults instantiates a new NetworkEquipmentToFabric object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetNetworkEquipmentIds

`func (o *NetworkEquipmentToFabric) GetNetworkEquipmentIds() []float32`

GetNetworkEquipmentIds returns the NetworkEquipmentIds field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetNetworkEquipmentIdsOk

`func (o *NetworkEquipmentToFabric) GetNetworkEquipmentIdsOk() (*[]float32, bool)`

GetNetworkEquipmentIdsOk returns a tuple with the NetworkEquipmentIds field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetNetworkEquipmentIds

`func (o *NetworkEquipmentToFabric) SetNetworkEquipmentIds(v []float32)`

SetNetworkEquipmentIds sets NetworkEquipmentIds field to given value.
